**Problem Statement**
Students seeking internships face challenges in managing multiple applications, including tracking deadlines, statuses, and follow-ups, which often leads to missed opportunities. Manually organizing application details is error-prone and inefficient. Additionally, students struggle to assess how well their skills align with job requirements, resulting in wasted effort on unsuitable roles. The lack of a clear, visual overview of their application progress further hinders motivation and organization. A streamlined solution is needed to simplify application management and improve alignment with opportunities.


**Overview**
doe is a centralized platform to help students efficiently manage, track, and evaluate their internship applications. The solution will automatically extract key details—such as deadlines, job titles, and required skills—from application links, enabling users to monitor progress and assess their alignment with role requirements in a structured and intuitive manner.
