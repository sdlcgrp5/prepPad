**Problem Statement** <br>
Students face significant challenges in securing internships and entry-level roles due to skill mismatches, ineffective resume tailor, and managing multiple applications. Traditional platforms like LinkedIn Learning or paid resume-review services are cost-prohibitive for students, who often lack the budget for subscriptions, and organizing application details on these platforms often requires external documentation like spreadsheets. Additionally, existing tools fail to provide actionable, personalized learning plans tied directly to job requirements.  A streamlined solution is needed to simplify application management and improve alignment with opportunities.

**Overview** <br>
prepPad addresses this by offering a student-centric, cost-free platform that automates resume-job matching and delivers curated learning steps to close gaps instantly. prepPad is a streamlined job-matching platform focused on helping users quickly compare their resumes to job postings and identify critical skill gaps. It prioritizes core functionality: resume parsing, job analysis, and actionable learning recommendations. The goal is to validate the product’s value proposition with minimal features while ensuring scalability.
